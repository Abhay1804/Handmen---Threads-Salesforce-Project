# Handmen---Threads-Salesforce-Project
Salesforce Virtual Internship – Handsmen Threads A retail simulation showcasing Apex classes, Flow automation, exception handling, and test-driven development. Built in Developer Edition with documented errors and solutions for real-world learning.


# 🧵 Handsmen Threads – Salesforce Virtual Internship Project

This repository contains Salesforce components developed for the **Handsmen Threads** retail simulation, completed during the Skill Wallet Virtual Internship. It demonstrates real-world application of Apex, Flow, and test-driven development in a retail order management context.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Handsmen Threads is a fictional apparel business used to simulate Salesforce development tasks. The goal was to build scalable, maintainable components that automate order processing and inventory tracking.

## 🔨 Technologies Used

- **Salesforce Apex** – Business logic for orders, inventory, and exception handling
- **Salesforce Flow** – Declarative automation for order lifecycle
- **Test Classes** – Unit testing for Apex logic with >75% code coverage
- **Developer Edition Org** – All components built and tested in a sandbox environment

## 📦 Features

- Order creation and inventory deduction via Apex
- Flow-based automation for order status updates
- Custom exception handling and debug logs
- Reusable helper classes and modular design
- Documented errors and resolutions for learning

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder        | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ApexClasses` | Core business logic and helper classes |
| `TestClasses` | Unit tests for Apex components        |
| `Flows`       | Flow metadata and screenshots         |
| `Docs`        | Error logs, notes, and documentation  |

## 📚 Best Practices Followed

- **Modular Apex Design**: Separation of concerns using helper classes
- **Declarative First**: Used Flow where possible before writing code
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **Code Coverage**: Focused on writing meaningful test cases
- **Documentation**: Logged errors and solutions for future reference

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened understanding of Apex and Flow
- Improved debugging and exception handling skills
- Practiced test-driven development and deployment readiness
- Learned to structure and document a Salesforce project professionally
